## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Max, and I'm a Computer Science student from PoznaÅ„ with experience in e-commerce and optimizing workflows.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development with full-stack JavaScript (Node.js + React), Docker and AWS. [Library Manager](https://github.com/maksym-sierszen/library-manager) is my learning playground.
